### Product Hypothesis Scoring
Score ideas across 5 dimensions:
1. **Customer Value** - How much does this solve a real problem?
2. **Business Impact** - What's the revenue/cost impact?
3. **Technical Feasibility** - Can we build this?
4. **Strategic Alignment** - Does this fit our strategy?
5. **Resource Requirements** - What will this cost?
