- **Technical Complexity** - How hard to build?
- **Dependencies** - External dependencies?
- **Technical Risk** - Known unknowns?

**Scoring:** 1 (Very Hard) to 5 (Very Easy)

### 4. Strategic Alignment (Weight: 20%)

## How to Use

### Step 1: List Your Ideas
Create a row for each product idea or feature

### Step 2: Score Each Dimension
Rate each idea on a 1-5 scale for all dimensions

### Step 3: Calculate Weighted Score
The template automatically calculates:
```
Total Score = (Customer Value √ó 0.25) + 
              (Business Impact √ó 0.25) + 
              (Technical Feasibility √ó 0.20) + 
              (Strategic Alignment √ó 0.20) + 
              (Resource Requirements √ó 0.10)
```

### Step 4: Rank & Prioritize
Sort by total score to get your priority order

### Step 5: Validate with Stakeholders
Review top-ranked items with key stakeholders
